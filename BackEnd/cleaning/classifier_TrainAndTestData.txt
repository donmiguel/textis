What we do: At Impetus, we work on Big Data Data Science problems arising out of various domains like network traffic monitoring, social media monitoring, retail, healthcare, finance, insurance etc. We thrive on a culture of asking the critical questions, continuous learning, hands-on experimentation and implementing interesting ideas. The data science team encourages its people to proactively look for real-world problems, collect publicly available data related to those problems, run their own data science experiments on those data and come up with end-to-end solutions for those problems. Members of our data science team and research lab regularly participate in data mining challenges and technical conferences. The interview conducted by the data science team is a thoroughly technical one, so candidates are recommended to brush up their basic understanding of machine learning statistical algorithms. We typically also ask for data-based open-ended use cases and the candidates are supposed to come up with an outline of their approach to solve the problem, with scientifically sound applications of machine learning. 
<unc> 
What to expect: You will find the interview an enjoyable experience if questions like the following excite you:
Suppose a TV network wants to optimize ad targeting on its TV channels. You have been given two datasets: one on people’s purchasing habits, and the other on their habits of watching different channels of the network. The two datasets were collected from two different sources, and the only common attribute between the two are the demographic variables (age, gender, location etc). How will you combine these two datasets?
How can class imbalance cause a problem in (supervised) classification, especially in cases like anomaly detection where the prior probability of the anomalous class is very low? How will you deal with the class imbalance problem? 
Suppose a big financial institution wants to detect fraudulent intent from the emails exchanged among its employees. They generate millions of emails per month but they have a very small set of emails (< 100) labeled as fraudulent. How will you approach the problem? Are you familiar with Active Learning?
What is the advantage of using logistic regression over linear regression? What are the special properties of the sigmoid curve?
What is a bootstrap sample? How is that used in Random Forest?
How are the set of basis vectors obtained in PCA related to the original set of basis vectors for the data? 
What is an ROC curve? How to check the quality of a predictive model for binary classification with a quick look at its ROC curve?
<unc> 
Company Details -Impetus is focused on creating big business impact through Big Data Solutions for enterprises in a wide range of industry verticals. The company brings together a unique mix of Data Science capabilities and technology expertise across the Big Data ecosystem including Hadoop, NoSQL, NewSQL, MPP databases, machine learning, and innovative visualization.
